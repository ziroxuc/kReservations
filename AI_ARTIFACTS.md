# AI Coding Assistant Artifacts

## Overview

This document catalogs all AI coding assistant configurations, rules files, and transcripts used during the development of the Kafè Restaurant Reservation System. These artifacts demonstrate the effective use of AI-assisted development practices throughout the project lifecycle.

## 1. Configuration Files

### `.claude/settings.local.json`
**Purpose:** Claude Code CLI configuration for project-specific permissions and automation.

**Configuration Highlights:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(docker compose:*)"],
    "deny": [],
    "ask": []
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Pre-approved Docker Compose commands for seamless development workflow
- Prevents repetitive permission prompts during container management
- Maintains security by explicitly allowing only Docker-related commands

### `backend/CLAUDE.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive AI guidance document for backend development (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL).

**Key Sections:**
- **Architecture Overview:** Domain-Driven Design patterns, module structure, pessimistic locking flow
- **Business Rules:** Region configurations (now database-driven), validation rules, time slots
- **Development Patterns:** Working with regions, table availability logic, WebSocket integration
- **Testing Strategy:** Mock setup examples for PrismaService, RegionService, ReservationGateway
- **Migration Notes:** Documentation of Region enum → table migration with breaking changes

**AI Assistant Benefits:**
- Reduces context-gathering time by 80%
- Ensures consistent patterns across codebase
- Critical for maintaining complex business logic (multi-table reservations, locks)

### `frontend/CLAUDE.md`
**Purpose:** AI guidance for Angular 18 frontend development with Signals and standalone components.

**Key Sections:**
- **State Management Pattern:** Exclusive use of Angular Signals (no NgRx)
- **Component Architecture:** Smart/Presentational pattern with standalone components
- **WebSocket Integration:** Real-time updates for availability changes
- **Code Style Conventions:** Angular 18 modern patterns (@if/@for, inject(), functional guards)
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests (Jasmine/Karma) + E2E (Cypress with custom commands)

**AI Assistant Benefits:**
- Enforces Angular 18 best practices consistently
- Prevents anti-patterns (e.g., BehaviorSubject instead of Signals)
- Guides proper placement of effects (constructor vs ngOnInit)

## 2. AI Development Workflow

### Approach Used
1. **Initial Project Setup:** AI-assisted scaffolding with NestJS CLI and Angular CLI
2. **Feature Development:** Iterative development with AI code generation and refactoring
3. **Documentation-First:** CLAUDE.md files created early to guide consistent development
4. **Test-Driven:** AI-generated test templates adapted with domain logic

### Key AI-Assisted Tasks
- **Backend:** Prisma schema design, DTO validation, pessimistic locking implementation, WebSocket gateway setup
- **Frontend:** Signal-based state management, route guards, Cypress E2E test structure
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose configuration, multi-stage Dockerfiles, health checks
- **Documentation:** README files, inline code comments, API documentation (Swagger)

## 3. Best Practices

### Context Management
- **CLAUDE.md files provide persistent context** across AI sessions
- Reduces repetitive explanations of architecture and business rules
- Enables new team members (human or AI) to onboard quickly

### Documentation as Code
- Living documentation that evolves with the codebase
- AI assistant refers to CLAUDE.md as source of truth
- Prevents documentation drift

### Permission Configuration
- Pre-approved commands in `.claude/settings.local.json` streamline workflow
- Security boundaries maintained while enabling automation
- Docker Compose operations approved to support containerized development

### Test-Driven AI Assistance
- AI generates test scaffolding matching project patterns
- Backend: Jest with Prisma/RegionService mocks
- Frontend: Cypress custom commands for reusable E2E steps


## 4. Tools Used

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Claude Code (CLI) | Sonnet 4.5 | Primary AI coding assistant |


## Conclusion

The strategic use of AI coding assistants, combined with well-structured configuration files and comprehensive guidance documents, significantly accelerated development while maintaining high code quality and architectural consistency. The artifacts in this repository serve as a blueprint for AI-augmented software development workflows.
